#### About

I am a third-year PhD student interested in programming languages and human-computer interaction.
I work on [Hazel](https://hazel.org/) with [Cyrus Omar](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~comar/) in the [FP Lab](https://github.com/fplab/fplab/wiki/The-Future-of-Programming-Lab) at the University of Michigan.
Currently I am focused on designing an efficient and easy-to-use structure editor.

Before grad school, I attended the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), worked as a software engineer at [Addepar](https://addepar.com/), and sang with [Choral Chameleon](http://www.choralchameleon.com/).

#### About

I am a second-year PhD student interested in programming languages and human-computer interaction.
I work on [Hazel](http://hazel.org/) with [Cyrus Omar](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~comar/) in the [FP Lab](https://github.com/fplab/fplab/wiki/The-Future-of-Programming-Lab) at the University of Michigan.
I used to work, and continue to collaborate, with [Ben Shapiro](http://benshapi.ro/) at the University of Colorado Boulder.

I received my bachelor's degree from Williams College in 2016.
As an undergrad, I worked on a variety of topics, ranging from [additive combinatorics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022314X1500181X) to [topological data analysis](assets/docs/nzp.pdf) to [dynamic race detection](assets/docs/poster.pdf).
My [thesis](assets/docs/thesis.pdf) was advised by [Stephen Freund](http://www.cs.williams.edu/~freund/index.html).

Before coming to Boulder, I lived in New York City.
There, I attended the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), worked as a software engineer at [Addepar](https://addepar.com/), co-taught an elective course on web development at the City College of New York, and sang with [Choral Chameleon](http://www.choralchameleon.com/).
